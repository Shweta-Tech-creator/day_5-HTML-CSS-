                    <h1>The Chapters That Shaped Me</h1>
                    <p><i>"Success is not defined by where you start or where you study, but by the skills you build and the mindset you embrace. Every setback is a setup for a stronger comeback. Keep learning, keep growing, and let your passion shape your future."</i></p>
                   
                </div>
                <p>When I received my JEE Mains score, it felt like a mix of triumph and heartbreakâ€”good, but not enough to meet the qualification criteria. For a moment, the weight of expectations overshadowed everything. But then, a realization changed everything: learning isnâ€™t just about the institution; itâ€™s about the skills you cultivate, the mindset you embrace, and the journey you carve out for yourself.<br>
                    That shift in perspective reshaped my goals. Instead of dwelling on where I couldnâ€™t go, I started focusing on what I could create, explore, and master. Web development became more than just a skillâ€”it became a form of self-expression, a way to build something meaningful.<br>
                    This chapter of my life taught me that success isnâ€™t tied to a ranking or a result. Itâ€™s about the value you bring to the world through what you know and how you grow. And that mindset has guided me ever since..</p>
